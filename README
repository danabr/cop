A little project inspired by Gecode to implement constraint programming in Erlang.

Note, this is purely for fun and the only goals are:
  * Fun
  * Correctness (in that all implemented propagators, branchers, search methods, etc work correctly)

It is not intented to be:
  * Usable for any serious problem solving
  * Efficient
  * Complete

If you are looking for solving real constrain programming problems, use real tools like Gecode.
